1 . Router can be used to define routes , just like in main Express Application.

Route parameters : 
1 .Route parameters are named URL segments that are used to capture the values specified at their specified position in the URL.
2 .The captured values are populated in the req.params object , with the name of the route parameter specified in the path as their respective keys
